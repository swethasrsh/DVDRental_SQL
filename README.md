# DVDRental_SQL
This project entails the creation of a set of SQL queries designed to address various business needs involving customer information, film details, and staff payment data within a movie rental database. The queries enable the retrieval of customer emails for promotional campaigns, identification of available MPAA movie ratings, and the fetching of specific customer contact details based on name or address. Additionally, the project includes queries to identify the first 10 paying customers, list the shortest movies, and determine which staff member processed the most payments. It also covers calculating the number of films with certain attributes, counting transactions exceeding a specific amount, and finding actors with names starting with a particular letter. The project further involves extracting unique customer districts, averaging replacement costs per movie rating, and identifying top-spending customers. Queries to determine customers eligible for platinum status based on transaction frequency, analyze spending with specific staff members, and count films starting with certain letters are also included. Moreover, the project identifies the customer with the highest ID for specific criteria, joins customer and payment data, retrieves emails for residents in specific locations, and lists movies featuring a particular actor.
